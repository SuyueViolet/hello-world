# hello-world
to get started

We will get there

Remember the days,
We sat out together with faiths?
Remember the time, so fine,
When we thought that 
nothing could stand in our way?

Then things weren't the same,
The life we knew had to change.
We struggled through, the darkest storms,
We thought we couldn't tame.

Togther we try,
As we stood side by side.
I know we've built a now world,
A world of hope forever after.
